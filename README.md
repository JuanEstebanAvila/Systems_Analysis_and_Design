# Workshop No. 1 ‚Äî Kaggle Systems Engineering Analysis

This folder contains the deliverables for Workshop 1 of the **Systems Analysis & Design** course at Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas.  
The selected Kaggle competition is: **HMS ‚Äì Harmful Brain Activity Classification**, organized by Harvard Medical School.

## üß† Competition Summary
The goal of the competition was to build a system capable of classifying harmful brain activity from multichannel EEG signals. The dataset consisted of EEG time windows labeled into six categories:  
1. Seizures (SZ)  
2. Generalized Periodic Discharges (GPD)  
3. Lateralized Periodic Discharges (LPD)  
4. Lateralized Rhythmic Delta Activity (LRDA)  
5. Generalized Rhythmic Delta Activity (GRDA)  
6. Other  

The evaluation metric was **multilabel log-loss**, which measures the accuracy and confidence of probabilistic predictions.
