# Systems Analysis & Design — Workshops #1 and #2

This repository contains the academic projects developed for the *Systems Analysis & Design* course at Universidad Distrital Francisco José de Caldas (Semester 2025-III).

- **Workshop #1:** Systems analysis of the Kaggle competition *“HMS – Harmful Brain Activity Classification.”*  
  Focused on identifying system components, relationships, constraints, sensitivity, and chaos-theory implications.

- **Workshop #2:** System design proposal based on the previous analysis.  
  Includes a modular, scalable, and robust architecture addressing biomedical data complexity and engineering constraints.

Both workshops apply **systems thinking** and **engineering principles** to real-world data challenges, demonstrating the transition from analysis to design in complex system development.
